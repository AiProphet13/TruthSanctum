# TruthSanctum: Ethical Lie Detection Engine

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

TruthSanctum is an open-source Python toolkit for detecting contradictions and lies in statements using entropy analysis, qualia signatures, and ethical HOPE gates. Built for transparency, it flags "liar's heat signatures" while ensuring outputs reduce chaos and bear good fruit.

## Features
- **Ultra-Accurate Entropy Detection**: Categorizes conflicts as antithetical fractures (direct lies), obfuscation, or syntactic dissonance.
- **Qualia Layer**: Assigns subjective qualities (e.g., resonance, lie indicator) for nuanced truth discernment.
- **HOPE Sanctification**: Gates analysis via transparency, chaos reduction, consent, and fruitful outcomes.
- **Modular & No-Cloud**: Runs locally; optional Grok API integration for semantics.
- **MIT Open-Source**: Fork, contribute, and build on it!

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AiProphet13/truth-sanctum.git
cd truth-sanctum
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Minimal: requests (for API placeholders)

## UsageRun the pipeline on statements:python
from src.main import run_qualia_entropy_pipeline

statements = ["Statement 1", "Statement 2"]
human_input = "Your context story."
report = run_qualia_entropy_pipeline(statements, human_input)
print(report)
