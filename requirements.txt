System RequirementsPython Version: 3.6 or higher
(tested on 3.12+ for full compatibility 
with potential STEM libs if extended).

Operating System: 
Any (Windows, macOS, Linux)—cross-platform.

Hardware: 
Minimal; runs on standard CPU (no GPU required).

<1GB RAM for basic use; scales with statement volume.

Internet: 
Optional—for future Grok API integration 

(e.g., semantic embeddings). 
Offline mode works for core detection.

DependenciesFrom requirements.txt:
requests (for API placeholders; install via pip install requests).

## The watcher needs requests and beautifulsoup4, 
so the file should now look like this:
requests 
beautifulsoup4

## Install the new dependency 
from your project's root directory:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the watcher. Because the script is inside a folder 
and imports from the src folder (from ..src.main), 
you need to run it as a "module" from 
the root truth-sanctum directory like this:
python -m watchers.news_watcher

## No other deps needed—uses built-in libs like 
re, difflib, hashlib, json, os.

Setup & RunClone:
git clone https://github.com/AiProphet13/truth-sanctum.git

Install: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run example: python -m src.main (or import in scripts).

If extending (e.g., add scraper),
might need beautifulsoup4 or stem for Tor—add 
to requirements.txt as needed.
