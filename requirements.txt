System RequirementsPython Version: 3.6 or higher
(tested on 3.12+ for full compatibility 
with potential STEM libs if extended).

Operating System: 
Any (Windows, macOS, Linux)—cross-platform.

Hardware: 
Minimal; runs on standard CPU (no GPU required).

<1GB RAM for basic use; scales with statement volume.

Internet: 
Optional—for future Grok API integration 

(e.g., semantic embeddings). 
Offline mode works for core detection.

DependenciesFrom requirements.txt:requests 
(for API placeholders; install via pip install requests).

No other deps needed—uses built-in libs like 
re, difflib, hashlib, json, os.Setup & RunClone: 

git clone https://github.com/AiProphet13/truth-sanctum.git
Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run example: python -m src.main (or import in scripts).

If extending (e.g., add scraper),
might need beautifulsoup4 or stem for Tor—add 
to requirements.txt as needed.
